		<p>The forest is a marvelous place, don't you think? The wonders of it seem endless, and yet you also realize that it can't last. The sun won't be lit forever, the darkness will roll in eventually and you know that when the time comes, you might not be prepared. The allure of it all, the seduction of escape, haunts you. How can you leave behind what you need the most? <br>But you decide you'd rather be alive and safe than put yourself in danger to chase a dream. It's probably best to head back the way you came.</p>
