		<p style="background-color:white">The game you used to play as a child, pretending the ground was lava, seems a little too prophetic to have just been a game. This experience, however, is like all of the hot lava to avoid and none of the childhood fun. You follow this path where the fire burns on each side in the hope that you won't end up charred to a crisp by the end of all of this. The heat is unbearable, the sweat driping down your face not helping very much. You'll have to move on forward quickly if you want to survive. <br>You have 5 seconds! Go!</p>
