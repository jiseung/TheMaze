		<p>You've lost your way along these winding paths,
			<br>You cannot see the light from where you came.
			<br>It's seeming bleak, you cannot do the math...
			<br>You look for something -- hope? Redemption? Fame?
			<br>You know not what your real objective is,
			<br>You realize with sudden 'piphany.
			<br>For no one ever told you what was this,
			<br>A maze? A game? A way to bring you glee?
			<br>These walls seem dark and unfamiliar,
			<br>For are they real or simply in your mind?
			<br>This feeling isn't new, but quite bizarre,
			<br>The knowing, understanding of this kind.
			<br>This maze may seem too long, but know the scheme--
			<br>Virtually, life is always but a dream.
