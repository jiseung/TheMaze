		<p style="background-color: white">Flames burn around you as you walk down a corridor - well, more like an oven. The roof above you burns menacingly, sending flaming debris raining over your head. The heat is sweltering, making you sweat and feel dizzy. You long for something, anything cold - a glass of water, anything! Yet, a part of you knows that if you just keep going, you can prevail. <br>Make a choice quickly - you have 7 seconds!</p>
