		<p style="color:white">You stumble and the floor beneath you suddenly gives - sneding you tubling into an abyss! You fall down, down, down, away from the harsh environment and into the darkness - a secret passage! In the darkness, you feel yourself sliding down as if on a slide, until you are finally depposited in The Danger Room. The room is circuar, the lights are dim, and lound noises come at you from every direction. And in the middle of the room is the thing you fear the most. The haunting power of the room incites anxiety, despair. You know you need to break out, you need to fight against the room. What can you do?<br>You only have 7 seconds!</p>
