		<p>You did it! Sacrifice is a beautiful thing. To sacrifice your resources for the greater good is amazing, and having been a part of this renews your determination. You like the feeling of being a part of something greater than yourself - it's an important one. After all, no one wants to feel alone. For now, you can put that aside as the door to your salvation has opened. Think of those who also sacrifice for the greater good, and brace for what is to come now..</p>
