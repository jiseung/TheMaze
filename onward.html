		<p>Your teeth chatter involuntarily as you make your way through the blizzard on the other side of this door. You feel cold in a way you have never experience before, like no amount of clothing or covering or heat could warm even your bones. Your breath seems to feeze upon exiting your mouth the tears on your eyelashes already forming icicles. you are unaware how you may continue to venture forth. You dream about the warmth that could have awaited you behind the other door, and wish that you could have only chosen that one instead. But, at the same time, curiosity propels you forward through the frost... <br>You have 7 seconds to decide what to do!!</p>
