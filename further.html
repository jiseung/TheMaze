		<p style="background-color: white">Wow, what a trip. You're surrounded by trees and you feel at ease, at home in nature. You wonder why you don't go outside as much anymore. A little alone time is all you need every now and again, and yet you find yourself with so little of it, using what small amounts of time you have to yourself to distract yourself with games and social media and television shows. You don't really feel isolated, at least, not until these precious moments you get alone with yourself. It's not until moments like these that you realize that only person you're really isolating yourself from is... you. But for now, you breathe in the fresh air, you let yourself relax, you smile at the idea of finally getting some alone time with yourself. And so you continue to venture onward.</p>
