		<p>You open the door in front of you and enter a dark room, not too different from the room in which you began. However, the biggest difference is that you can;t find a light switch - You search left and right but you come up with nothing. The darkness is closing in all around you and you wonder what to do. Maybe you should keep trying to interact with the space around you, or use this as a chance to just sit and be alone and thing. On the other hand, maybe you should just get out while you can.</p>
