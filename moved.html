		<p style="color:white">The inside world. A place safe from whatever may or may not be out there, whatever 'out there' is. Your time in nature has come to an end unfortunately but the pleasures of a nice cozy inside keep you from total devestation. Beauty is in the eye of a beholder after all and looking at this room you can't help but feel a small joy knowing that you've got a roof over your head once again to shield you from what you may not be comfortable with. <br>In front of you is a door that says "I'm glad you enjoyed yourself" and it's the only way to go. You wonder if you can trust it, but you feel as though there's no pont in not seeing what lies ahead any longer.</p>
