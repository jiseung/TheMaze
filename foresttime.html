But the words echo in your head - direction, or just being? You realize you don't really know what you're doing here. Do you have some sort of objective? Why press forward if there's no purpose to it? And even if there was, who would have designed that purpose? What does it all mean? Why did nobody tell you what you're supposed to be doing? But would that make it better? Perhaps your best option is simply to press forward, if for nothing else, for the sake of your curiosity. I mean, don't you want to know, even a little bit, how it all ends?</p>
