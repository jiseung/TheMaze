		<p style="background-color:white">The times we spend in nature aren't always taken for granted. Sometimes we feel its importance in our lives when we must step outside to start the day. Sometimes we hate it - our allergies kick in, a storm rages, the wind chills us to our bones. But today is not that kind of day. The sun is shining through the leaves, painting patterns of green on the earthen floor beneath you. The air is clear and sweet, any allergies you have somehow at rest. You feel as though you have been born anew, as though you are walking through a dream. But, alas, all dreams must end. With almost no warning, you approach a large stone wall with a red door. You wonder if you should go through it - this beautiful forest world has given you so much, but curiosity draws you to the door. What's more important - letting yourself be, or going in a direction and finding your way?</p>
