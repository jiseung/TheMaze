		<p>You find yourself now in a room of varying temperatures. On one side of the room, a cool breeze whistles, making you shiver, and you can see frost literally coming in through a door on that side. On the other side, you can feel the blistering heat and through a crack in the door you can see a light source that suspiciously resembles fire. Neither of these seem very pleasant... maybe you should head back the way you came.</p>
