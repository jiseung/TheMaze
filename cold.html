		<p style="background-color:white">The relentless chatter of your teeth echoes through your frozen bones. The cold air hurts every fiber of your being, every hair on your body standing on end. You're not sure how you even got this far, but you're in this now and the frost is taking over. Your eyes blink in pain as each drop of liquid they emit is immediatley turned into ice. You must continue onward or face a dangerous consequence. <br> Quickly! You have 5 seconds!</p>
