		<p>The area around you has been yet unclear. In one sense you feel an intense heat and cold eminating from somewhere, at other points you can hear the faint sounds of music and perhaps various poems beng read aloud on a loop. At the same time, birds chirp nearby. The sweet sounds of nature await somewhere but you don't know how you might get there. All paths lead somewhere, but your goal, your escape, that is, (at least, you think that's your goal), is all that occupies your mind. You come across a wall with two doors, One to your right and the other forward. Which do you choose?</p>
