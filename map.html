		<p>As you walk to the map, you accidentally trip over a wire, which sounds an alarm. You should have known -- the way to the map was booby-trapped! The floor opens up beneath you and you fall into a chasm, landing hard on the ground. When you finall get the strength to pick yourself up from the fall, you see that you have landed in a dungeon room. It's rather lived in, and it seems as though the previous occupant found a way to escape and installed a ladder to the next room.</p>
